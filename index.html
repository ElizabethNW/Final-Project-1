      <h2 id="about-heading">About Us</h2>
      <p>We are a team of qualified Life Coaches and Mental Health First Aiders,
        currently training as Counsellors in and around South Wales, including
        Cardiff. Our work is grounded in empathy, professionalism, and a
        commitment to creating a safe, supportive environment for every client.</p>

      <p>As part of our training and ethical practice, some counselling sessions
        may be observed by a qualified supervisor. This helps ensure high‑quality
        support and reflective practice. We only proceed with your full consent,
        and your comfort and confidentiality remain our priority.</p>
    
      <p>To make counselling more accessible, our trainee counsellor sessions are
        offered at a reduced rate starting from £20 per hour. Coaching sessions
        with fully qualified Coaches are available from £45 per hour.</p>
